below please email your question to the IS&T advisor: Candace Lavaka - 
candace.lavaka@uvu.edu.

<h2>
Question:  
</h2>

<p>
How is IS/IT different from Computer Science?
</p>

<h2>
Answer:
</h2>

<p>
To be sure there is a degree of overlap between these disciplines. 
Both study computer hardware and software. Computer Science studies in depth the internal 
operations of computers and the development of systems software to make computers easy to use. 
IS/IT, on the other hand, is concerned more with the users and business uses of computers than 
with the computers themselves. IS/IT requires a moderate-level of programming and a little 
hardware knowledge; however, its primary focus is on using the technology to meet business needs.

<h2>
Question: 
</h2>

<p>
Why do I have to pay a lab fee for a class? What if I don't use the lab computers? 
</p>

<h2>
Answer: 
</h2>

<p>
All fees go toward maintaining state-of-the-art hardware and software technology 
for your use while at school and for printing up to 200 pages from the lab computers. 
We have found that student's who request a refund of the fee soon wish that they hadn't, 
so please take advantage of this great service. There are no waiting lines to use the 
School of Technology and Computing.

<h2>
Student Testimonial:
</h2>

<p>
"I have found it very helpful to clarify questions I have in the program before making decisions 
like deciding on what classes to take in what order.  I would hate to have made a bad guess and
spend an entire semester in a course I did not need to graduate.  If my advisor is not available,
I try to check these FAQs to see if the answer to my question is here." -- Jane Doe --
