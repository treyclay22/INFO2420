<li>My first impression was that I was slightly underwhelmed. There are a lot of words on the screen and it feels a little cluttered. <br>I think the website looks better/more interesting as you scroll down, though.</li>
<li>The information on this website flows downwards. As you scroll, there are links to a book, and to amazon. There are also links at the <br>bottom to click on, leading to various social media accounts.</li> 
<li>I think the general layout of the website makes sense. It is pretty concise and and you scroll, the order of the information just makes sense.</li>
<li>While I like the way the information is delivered, I sort of think that some of the graphics don't help. For some reason the picture at <br>the very top makes the page look slightly unfinished to me.<br>I do like the way the book is displayed though. But like I mentioned earlier there's just generally a large clutter of words.</li>
<li>This website loaded very quickly. On mobile as well.</li>
<li>I think the text color and size were fine, and I liked the light blue background. I especially like how it switches off with the white background as you scroll</li>
<li>There is a scroll bar on the right, and a menu at the top to navigate. Overall it is very effective.</li>
<li>There is a definite color palette for this website, that being black, white, and light blue. This was consistent throughout the website and looked great to me.</li>
<li>This website responds super well to varying window sizes. On mobile, you still scroll down but the top menu is now tucked away in a sidebar.<br>The same is true as you shrink the window on PC. The images and text also sustain their readability very well.</li>
<li>I really appreciate the overall structure of the website. While parts of it could look better, there is a very strong flow of <br>information while still separating that information into smaller chunks</li>
